Heyo, I've made a plugin so you can insert the beautifully-crafted icons made by Feather. They've went thru a pixelfix process, as well as exported in 512*512.

The plugin includes a search feature, which can be helpful if you want to find a specific icon without scrolling around.

Though, no light theme support yet ;(
